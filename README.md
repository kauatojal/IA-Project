**Energy Consumption Classification**

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying energy consumers as residential or commercial. The model leverages historical energy consumption data, collected at 2-hour intervals over a 24-hour period, to make accurate predictions.

## Goal

* **Accurate Classification:** Develop a robust model that can accurately classify new customers as residential or commercial.
* **Energy Management:** Provide insights to energy companies for better management and optimization of energy resources.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical energy consumption data for both residential and commercial consumers.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure data quality and consistency.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the raw data to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection and Training:** Experiment with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors) and select the best performing model.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

# IA-Project

**Energy Consumption Classification**

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying energy consumers as residential or commercial. The model leverages historical energy consumption data, collected at 2-hour intervals over a 24-hour period, to make accurate predictions.

## Goal

Accurate Classification: Develop a robust model that can accurately classify new customers as residential or commercial.
Energy Management: Provide insights to energy companies for better management and optimization of energy resources.
Methodology

Data Collection: Gather historical energy consumption data for both residential and commercial consumers.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure data quality and consistency.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the raw data to improve model performance.
Model Selection and Training: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors) and select the best performing model.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).


## Technologies Used

Python: Programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
SQLite: Database for storing and managing the dataset.
